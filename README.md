## Project Description

This is a **daily planning interface** where users can input tasks and have an AI generate a plan for the day.
I first used Zypher **Interactive CLI Mode**, providing prompts to help design and prototype the interface. Then, in the backend `server.ts` file, I integrated a Zypher agent so it can generate and return appropriate daily schedule plans.

The prompt I used when using Interactive CLI Mode:

```
Please help me create an AI daily planning interface. The interface consists of two panels: the right panel is a chat input where the user describes what they want or need to accomplish today, and the left panel displays a structured daily plan generated by you.
```
